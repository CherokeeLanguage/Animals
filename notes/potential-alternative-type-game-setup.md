# Animals Game: Rethink

Playboard is composed of dropping blocks with animal pics on them.

A challenge is issued and blocks are dropped, the quicker the correct blocks
are selected, the more points. The block is removed immediately from the board.

Each game is about 5 minutes.

The sessions are tracked using a Leitner Boxing approach.

Each session is counted as if a full Leitner day period has elapsed.
